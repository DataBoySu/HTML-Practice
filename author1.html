                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" color="red">William Shakespeare</a> <b>(23 April 1564 - 23 April 1616)</b> was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. <p>He is often called England's national poet and the <b>"Bard of Avon"</b> (or simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. <br>His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. <p>Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.<p>Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. <br>Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner ("sharer") of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men after the ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. <p>At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later.
